# SWEN20003 Shadow Mario Project
## Acknowledgement
All questions, resources (in res folder, with properties for the game
and images), main library (Bagel) and a minimal amount of 
skeleton code (general set up of ShadowMario class)
are provided as part of the assignment by UniMelb, SWEN20003 
Sem 1 2024.

## Project
The project specification and designs are included in 
the "specification" and "uml" folders. The game is a mimic of 
Mario (hence Shadow Mario), which is simple, with the main challenge
lies in structuring and ensuring good OOP design principles with
care and design patterns (Observer, Singleton, Factory Method, Iterator)

## Run Project
1. Install the project as a Maven project (Recommended IntelliJ)
2. Run the ShadowMario main class in "src" folder
